# WP Quick Post or Draft

Intro: Write a quick draft or post from a pop up editor on the front end of your website.

## == Description ==
Have you ever wanted to stay on the front end of your website and write a quick post or draft from there? This plugin will allow you to do just that!

Please note: this plugin currently requires the WordPress REST API (Version 2) plugin (which you can download here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/).

The idea of this plugin is that it is quick to post from the front end, and only gives you 3 fields to fill out: Post Title, Post Content, and Category. From there, you can save it as a draft, or post it immediately. The plugin uses the WP REST API to post the data.

Please refer to Installation and Screenshots to see how to insall and set this plugin up and use it.

Instructions for use:
1. Click on the blue slide out button to pull up the popup.
2. Fill out the Title, Content, and Category (thought you don't need a category filled out).
3. Click on the button to save as a draft or immediately post.
4. Upon successful posting, you'll see a confirmation box, then you can close the popup or it will close in 5 seconds.

Upcoming features:

- Work without WP REST API using backward compatible XML-RPC for posting
